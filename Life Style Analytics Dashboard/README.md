# Lifestyle Analytics Dashboard

A Tableau-based dashboard analyzing key lifestyle factors including **Occupation, Daily walking Steps, Stress Level, Physical Activity Level, Heart Rate**, and **Quality of Sleep**. This project aims to uncover relationships between work patterns and overall health outcomes.

---

## Project Overview

The Lifestyle Analytics Dashboard provides insights into:  
- Sleep behavior across different occupations  
- Stress patterns and their connection to sleep  
- Influence of physical activity on heart rate  
- Overall lifestyle quality indicators  
- Relationships between behavioral and physiological metrics  

The dashboard helps identify trends that can guide wellness initiatives and personal health improvements.

## Dataset Description

Key variables used in the dashboard:  
- **Occupation** – Participant’s job category  
- **Daily Steps** – Daily walking step count  
- **Stress Level** – Self-reported stress score  
- **Physical Activity Level** – Daily activity intensity  
- **Heart Rate** – Average heart rate (resting/overall)  
- **Quality of Sleep** – User-assessed sleep quality rating

## Dashboard Features

- Interactive filters by occupation and activity level  
- Bar charts showing sleep duration and quality  
- Scatter plot linking sleep and stress  
- Activity–heart rate relationship visualization  
- Summary metrics and trend indicators

## Future Recommendations

- **Improve Data Reliability:** Integrate device-based metrics (wearables), use validated scales for stress and sleep, and apply data cleaning and consistency checks.  
- **Consolidate Multiple Data Sources:** Combine wearables, surveys, workplace reports, and lifestyle apps using ETL tools (Tableau Prep, Python, Alteryx); standardize formats.  
- **Enhance Dashboard Depth:** Add time-series data, predictive insights (burnout risk, sleep trends), and benchmark comparisons.  
- **Strengthen Data Governance:** Implement privacy controls, secure access, and maintain metadata/documentation.
